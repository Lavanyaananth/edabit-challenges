      This Triangular Number Sequence is generated from a pattern of dots that
      form a triangle. The first 5 numbers of the sequence, or dots, are:`1, 3,
      6, 10, 15` This means that the first triangle has just one dot, the second
      one has three dots, the third one has 6 dots and so on. Write a function
      that returns the number of dots when given its corresponding triangle
      number of the sequence.
